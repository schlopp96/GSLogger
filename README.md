## About GSLogger

- GSLogger is a simple Google search engine URL-scraper.
- Essentially users can search for a topic, (optionally) log the search results, and even open the URL from the application if desired, using the bottom-most input field.

## Future Plans

- While this is an extremely simple project originally built for GUI-practice-purposes, I may expand on it now and again as I continue my CS education, so stay tuned for any improvements or updates in the future.
